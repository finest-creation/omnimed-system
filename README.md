# omnimed-system
Project developed by Insituto Federal de São Paulo (Federal Institute of São Paulo) - Campus São João da Boa Vista, aiming to attend the population with a telemedicine system.

## Context
This project is the evaluation method used in Integrative Project in Software Development of the Computer Science course. Its features were split into 3 different modules:

1. Users (profile);
2. Online office (online appointment management);
3. Medical Services (online medical services management).

Each module is a team composed of 6 people: 3 were **analysts** and the other 3 were **developers**. The analysts were responsible for the creation of unit tests for the system, poiting out bugs and preparing the front-end of the module. The developers were responsible for the back-end of the program, creating the bulk of the system: setting up connections to the database, programming features and correcting bugs. Each module had 1 **project owner** and 1 **scrum master**.

## Responsibilities of each module:

Module 1:
- Schedule and confirm appointments online then refer patients to specialists based on the symptoms described during the consultation and notify the patient;
- manage appointment screening and online consultations carried out by specialists;
- request the appropriate referral for in-person consultations, view their medical histories, appointment/consultation records, and prescriptions.

Module 2:
- Patient registration in the system, patient dependency management and employee management,
- system login, profile information editing and password recovery,
- contact us/frequently asked questions (F.A.Q), project and IFSP information and welcome page;
- access control, and sector contact management.

Module 3:
- managing exam management, medical guides, medication guides, specialty guides;
- manage payments, and medical plans based on the logged-in profile and profile-related privileges.

## Tecnology used:

Development
- phpMyAdmin: Free and open-source web application developed in PHP for administering MySQL over the Internet.
- XAMPP: It is a package containing the leading open source servers on the market, including FTP, MySQL database, and Apache with support for PHP and Perl languages. The program is released under the GNU license and acts as a free, easy-to-use web server capable of interpreting dynamic pages.
- BrModelo: It is an application for those who work with systems, more specifically with databases. It allows you to create conceptual relational models, ranging from simple modeling to others with a complete logical schema.

Version Control:
- TortoiseSVN: TortoiseSVN is a Subversion client for Microsoft Windows. Open source and licensed under the GNU General Public License, it helps you manage different versions of your projects' source code.

Test development:
- TestLink: Web-based software developed for software testing that aims to facilitate testing and ensure software quality. The platform supports test cases, test plans, unit testing, among others, and also supports reports and statistics.

Agile Methodology:
- Kanban: A visual management method that uses boards and cards to organize and monitor workflow. With columns representing the stages of a process (such as “To Do”, “In Progress” and “Done”), cards are moved between them to indicate the progress of tasks, facilitating real-time management and visualization of work. The goal is to increase efficiency and transparency, allowing teams to focus on what needs to be done at the right time.
